"# myWeatherApp" 
Cohort 3 JS/CSS/HTML Project: Building a Weather Application
We have an exciting project for you! Your task is to build a beautiful and responsive web application that
collects the user&#39;s name, location, and provides real-time weather information for their location, and the
exact time. Additionally, the app should offer interesting facts or details about the country where the
user is residing.
Here are the specific requirements:
Input Fields:
Create a user-friendly interface to collect the user&#39;s name and location.
Weather Information:
Integrate a weather API to fetch and display real-time weather conditions based on the user&#39;s location.
Country Information:
Utilize another API to retrieve and display interesting facts or details about the country where the user is
currently residing.
Responsive Design:
Ensure that the application is responsive and works seamlessly across all screen sizes and devices.
Promises Handling:
Implement all asynchronous operations (API calls) using promises.
Make sure to handle promises appropriately â€“ all promises must be returned, and any errors
encountered should be thrown. Feel free to bootstrap .
Remember, not only does the functionality matter, but the user interface should be visually appealing.
Let&#39;s aim for both functionality and aesthetics!
